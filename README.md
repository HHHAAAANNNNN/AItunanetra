# AITUNANETRA - Mobile Application for Low-Vision Students

## Research Overview & Results

AITUNANETRA is a mobile application developed specifically to assist low-vision students in understanding objects and their surrounding environment within educational contexts. The application was created through a user-centered design approach with direct involvement of students from SLB-A YPAB Gebang Putih Surabaya, resulting in a solution tailored to their unique needs and challenges.

### Development Methodology

The application was developed using the **Design Thinking methodology** with three iterative testing cycles involving five low-vision students. This approach enabled continuous refinement based on real user feedback, addressing critical usability issues at each stage:

- **First iteration** identified major pain points including confusing initial guides, unnecessary login pages, hidden exit buttons, and gesture controls incompatible with TalkBack
- **Second iteration** resolved navigation issues, improved button labeling for screen readers, and added easy access to user guides
- **Final iteration** produced a version that students could operate independently with minimal assistance

### Key Features

- **Voice-guided interface** with comprehensive audio instructions in Indonesian
- **Dual-control system** for both gesture-based and button-based interactions
- **Integrated flashlight and microphone controls** optimized for low-vision users
- **TalkBack-compatible design** with proper text labels for all interactive elements
- **Streamlined navigation** without unnecessary authentication steps
- **On-demand tutorial access** from any screen within the application

### Research Results & Evaluation

The final prototype was evaluated using the **QUIM (Quality in Use Integrated Measure)** instrument across 10 usability factors. The application achieved an overall score of **79.2** (categorized as "Good"), with particularly strong performance in:

- **Learnability (92/100)** - Students quickly understood how to use the application after minimal instruction
- **Efficiency (90/100)** - The application effectively helped students complete assigned tasks
- **Accessibility (86/100)** - Excellent compatibility with TalkBack and other screen readers
- **Satisfaction (84/100)** - Positive user experience during educational activities
- **Usefulness (86/100)** - Practical value in classroom learning contexts

Areas identified for improvement include:
- **Security (64/100)** and **Trust (68/100)** - Students expressed concerns about camera/microphone usage permissions and data privacy
- **Effectiveness (74/100)**, **Productivity (72/100)** and **Universality (76/100)** - Further adaptation needed for diverse learning scenarios

### Conclusion & Future Development

AITUNANETRA demonstrates that Design Thinking methodology is highly effective for developing assistive applications for visually impaired users, particularly when incorporating multiple iterations with direct user involvement. The research confirms that applications for this demographic require specialized design considerations beyond standard accessibility guidelines.

**Recommended improvements for future development:**
- Enhanced security explanations to address user concerns about permissions
- Simplified user flows to minimize navigation steps to core features
- Expansion of educational scenarios supported by the application
- Testing with totally blind users to ensure compatibility across the full spectrum of visual impairments
- Integration of participatory design approaches involving teachers and parents as co-designers

This research makes a meaningful contribution to assistive technology for education by demonstrating how context-specific applications can be developed through iterative user testing with the actual beneficiaries of the technology, resulting in solutions that genuinely address their unique challenges in educational settings.
